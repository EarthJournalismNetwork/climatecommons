		<h1>About this map</h1>
		<p>Climate Commons is a map-based interactive platform that  contains layers of news and information on climate change in the US. It is  designed to provide academics, policymakers, journalists, and the general  public with the latest data and stories on the causes and impacts of, and  responses to climate change across the country. The map combines the most  recently available data on climate change indicators, such as temperature,  precipitation, and emissions, with the latest, geo-tagged stories on climate  change in the United States. </p>
    <p>By providing users with the ability to compare recent  data and media coverage on a local, regional, and national level, Climate  Commons aims to inform Americans about the impacts of and responses to climate  change in their own towns, regions and states. It also serves as a tool for  better analyzing the perception and realities of climate change across the US. </p>
        <p><b><strong>How to Use Climate Commons - Zoom In!</strong></b></p>
<p>There are several ways you can use this map. You may want to begin by zooming in to a  town, region or state you&rsquo;re particularly interested in. As you zoom in, the  map will be redrawn to provide more detailed information, and the stories  sidebar will filter out all stories not within the immediately visible map  frame.</p>
<p>Climate change stories about the region, represented by  dots, should then appear in your frame (to the extent such stories have been  produced recently). You can access them by first clicking on the dot and then  on the link that appears in the sidebar on the right, which will take you to  the original story.</p>
<p>Data trends are also shown more clearly as you zoom in.  To visualize different types of data on climate change indicators, click on the  category tab in the upper left-hand corner of the map. When exploring weather patterns, users have the  option to trace annual averages, monthly anomalies, or extreme events. A legend  on the left side of the map indicates the units, scale, and severity of each issue.  By clicking the source link under each legend, users can access the publicly  available data. </p>
<p>Finally, users can search for stories on a specific  climate-related issue in one of two ways: using the filters just above the  stories sidebar, or by searching for a specific term in the search bar in the  upper right-hand corner. </p>
<p><b>Data Calculation</b></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll note that the data is geographically sorted  through the use of hexagon cells. There are two different methods used for calculating  the value associated with each hexagon l, depending on the nature of the data. </p>
<p>For data sets that are not continuous in nature (such as  damaging wind events), each cell adds up the values of the data points within  it. Some gaps appear in the map with this method, because some cells contain no  data points. The total hexagon values reflect either a sum of values (for  example emissions) or a count of data points if the data are individual  incidents.</p>
<p>For continuous data (temperature, for example), each  hexagon cell is an interpolated value based on surrounding data. This  essentially looks at every data point (whether within the cell or not), weights  its value based on its distance from the cell center, and then assigns the cell  value based on all those weighted values. </p>
<p>The data presented here comes from publicly available  sources that include National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the U.S. Geological Survey  (USGS). The source of and time frame for each data set is indicated at the  bottom of each drop down menu. All of the available data can be accessed by  clicking on the source link located in lower left-hand corner of the menu. </p>
